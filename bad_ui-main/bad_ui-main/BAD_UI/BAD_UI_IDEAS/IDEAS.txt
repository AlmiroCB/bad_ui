BAD UI IDEAS:

OVERALL IDEAS: IMPLEMENT CHEAT CODES THORUGHOUT THE PROJECT :
1) CHEAT CODE & INNERHTML TO GET TO NEXT PAGE ON INDEX.HTML__

1) RNG CHECK -->
1. 1 Empty output field & 1 Button --> Press Button to create random number --> Show it in the empty output field -- > 1 Press only until reload 
2. 1 output field && Button --> Press Button to create random number --> Show it in output field --> (maybe timer how often you can press button)
--> If both NUMBERS match --> NOTIFICATION you can procceed
MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO TYPE IN WORDS ==> EITHER INVENT A CHEAT CODE OR LET USER INSERT CODE VIA .innerHTML to let themselves pass.
--> PROMPT --> YES OR NO --> YES: REDIRECT NEXT PAGE || NO: CIA 
--> RANDOM IMG VERIFYIER --> MATCH IMAGES
2) When clicked 'OK' on notification,  new inputs pop up --> asking to type in CREDITCARD information
--> when you did that, it tells you it wasnt even needed, but thank you

3) Now the real form to login pops up --> have to type your data in binary/(maybe other system)

--> DO THIS, THEN NEW IDEAS!!

4) HAVE FORM / TABLE WHERE USER GETS TROLLED ==> 
- ONE OF THE INPUTS RETURNS STRING REVERSED, SO USER HAS TO TYPE IN THE ANSWER IN REVERSE
- GENERATE NEVER ENDING INPUTS
